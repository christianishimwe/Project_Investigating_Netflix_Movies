Project Overview:

For the project titled "Investigating Netflix Movies," I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset (netflix_data.csv) to gain insights into movies from the 1990s. The main objectives were to:
Identify the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s.
Determine the number of short action movies (defined as movies with a duration less than 90 minutes) released during that decade.





Key Concepts and Skills Acquired:






Data Manipulation and Cleaning:
Pandas Library: I gained proficiency in using the Pandas library to manipulate and analyze data. Specifically, I learned how to read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame, which is essential for handling large datasets in Python. This skill was foundational for all subsequent analysis.
Filtering DataFrames: I learned how to filter data based on specific conditions. For example, to find movies from the 1990s with durations less than 90 minutes, I applied logical conditions to the DataFrame to extract the relevant subset of data. This involved creating filters using Pandas' Series objects and chaining them together to refine the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Histograms and Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib, I learned to visualize data through histograms, which allowed me to quickly identify the most frequent movie duration in the dataset. This graphical representation is critical for understanding the distribution of data and making informed decisions based on it.

Descriptive Statistics: Through this project, I applied basic descriptive statistics to identify trends within the dataset, such as determining the most common movie duration. This involved analyzing the histogram and selecting the mode of the distribution.

Logical and Conditional Operations:
Applying Logical Conditions: I enhanced my ability to use logical operators to filter data. For instance, I used the np.logical_and() function to identify movies that were both less than 90 minutes in duration and released in the 1990s. This competency is crucial for performing more complex data queries and analyses.

Data Subsetting:
Extracting Relevant Data: I learned how to subset DataFrames to isolate specific columns or rows that are of interest. In this project, I extracted data on movie durations and release years to perform targeted analyses. This skill is vital for reducing large datasets to manageable and relevant information for analysis.

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving:
Iterative Problem Solving: During the project, I encountered challenges such as errors due to mismatched data sizes when subsetting. I developed a systematic approach to debugging and resolving these issues, which involved re-examining the size and content of DataFrames to ensure compatibility when performing operations.

Experimentation: I was encouraged to experiment with the data after completing the main objectives, which allowed me to further explore the dataset and solidify my understanding of the tools and methods used.

Project Documentation and Communication:
Code Documentation: Throughout the project, I documented my code with comments to explain each step of the analysis. This practice is essential for maintaining clarity in data science workflows, ensuring that both I and others can easily understand the logic and purpose behind each code block.

Result Interpretation: I learned how to interpret and present the results of my analysis effectively. This includes summarizing key findings, such as the most frequent movie duration and the number of short action movies, and explaining the methods used to arrive at these conclusions.




Competencies Developed:




Proficiency in Python for Data Analysis: Developed strong foundational skills in Python, particularly in using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

Analytical Thinking: Enhanced my ability to think critically about data, identify patterns, and derive insights from complex datasets.

Problem Solving: Built problem-solving skills by tackling and resolving issues that arose during the data analysis process, particularly related to data filtering and manipulation.
Attention to Detail: Cultivated a keen attention to detail in both data analysis and code documentation, ensuring that my work is both accurate and reproducible.




Conclusion:




This project not only allowed me to apply my newly acquired data science skills but also deepened my understanding of data manipulation, visualization, and analysis in Python. Through hands-on experience, Iâ€™ve become more proficient in EDA techniques and more confident in my ability to tackle similar projects in the future. This project has also equipped me with the practical skills and knowledge necessary for a data science career, particularly in roles involving data analysis, business intelligence, and data-driven decision-making.
